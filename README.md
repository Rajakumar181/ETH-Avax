Project Title
Owner Access Contract

Simple Overview of Use/Purpose
This Solidity smart contract restricts access to certain functions so that only the owner of the contract can execute them. It includes functions for performing basic arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction, which are restricted to the owner.

Description
The ownerAccess contract is designed to demonstrate access control in smart contracts. It sets the deployer of the contract as the owner and uses a modifier to restrict access to certain functions. The contract includes two arithmetic functions: addition and subtraction, both of which can only be called by the owner of the contract.

Getting Started
Installing
Install Remix IDE or any other Solidity development environment.
Create a new file and copy the ownerAccess contract code into it.
How/Where to Download Your Program
The contract code can be directly copied from the provided snippet and pasted into your development environment.
Any Modifications Needed to Be Made to Files/Folders
No modifications are needed to the contract code for basic usage.
Executing Program
How to Run the Program
Open Remix IDE and create a new file named ownerAccess.sol.
Paste the provided contract code into ownerAccess.sol.
Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler version 0.8.9.
Deploy the contract to a local blockchain (e.g., Remix VM) or a testnet (e.g., Ropsten, Rinkeby).
Step-by-Step Bullets
Open Remix IDE.
Create a new file: ownerAccess.sol.
Paste the contract code into ownerAccess.sol.
Select the appropriate compiler version (0.8.9).
Compile the contract.
Deploy the contract using the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
Interact with the deployed contract using the available functions (addition and subtraction).

pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {

        _;
    }

    function addition(uint256 u, uint256 v) public view onlyOwner returns (uint256) {
        return u + v;
    }

    function subtraction(uint256 w, uint x) public view onlyOwner returns (uint256) {
        return w - x;
    }
}
Help
Any Advice for Common Problems or Issues
Ensure you are using the correct Solidity compiler version (0.8.9).
Only the address that deployed the contract can call the addition and subtraction functions. If you receive an "only owner can access" error, make sure you are using the owner address.
